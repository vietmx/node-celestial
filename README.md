# Celestial theme
A WordPress theme using React 16, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack 3.

Update (July 25, 2018):
1. Commented out some unnecessary unqueues
2. Updated footer with dynamic year and center text
3. Used the Loader where appropriate
4. Updated almost all packaages (React to v16.4.1)

I intend to continue developing the project by building the Next Steps of the article in the **'next-steps'** branch.
